Fix Printer Offline in Windows 10: If you are facing some issues with your printer then generally restarting the printer can pretty much fix most of these issues. But if your printer is offline even after being fully connected to the PC then this issue can’t be fixed by a simple restart. Users are complaining that they can’t use the printer because their printer is offline even though their printer in ON, connect to the PC and fully operational.

If your printer is not working, or the print command doesn’t seem to respond then you can check if your device status if offline or not. To verify this, press Windows Key + R then type control printers and hit Enter. Or you could navigate to the Devices and Printers in Control Panel then select the desired printer and under the ribbon, at the bottom, you will see something like this “Status: Offline”. If this is the case then your printer is offline and until you resolve this issue the printer won’t work.

## Why does the Printer Offline error occur?

The error appears when Windows 10 sees that the printer is unavailable.

Unfortunately, most of the time, it can’t tell if the printer is really offline or if it has connectivity problems or printing errors. They might occur when:

* The connection between the computer and the printer is slow/unresponsive
* The printer has encountered an internal error
* There are multiple unfinished print jobs in the queue
